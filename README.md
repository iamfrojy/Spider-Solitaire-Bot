(to get it download the linux folder for the beta testing version.)
(there also may be bugs.)
Section 1
How to run the file

ONLY WORKS ON LINUX!

HOW TO EXECUTE .bin ON LINUX:

Run /path/to/bot.bin

HOW TO GIVE EXECUTE PERMISSIONS:

Run chmod +x /path/to/bot.bin
-------------------------------
Section 2
How to use the bot

To enter a cards name (example: king of spades)
just write KS and don't space out the letters like K S.

Also the bot will not solve the whole thing, it will only help
you with moves your stuck on.
